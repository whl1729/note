# Reading note: Dealing with files

1. Where to store?
    -  When you are working on a website locally on your computer, you should keep all the related files in a **single folder** that mirrors the published website's file structure on the server.

2. Casing and Spacing
    - Name folders and files completely in **lowercase** with no spaces and with words separated by **dashes**.
    - It's better to separate words with dashes, rather than underscores. Because The Google search engine treats a hyphen as a word separator but does not regard an underscore that way.

3. Website's Structure
    - `index.html`
    - `images` folder
    - `styles` folder
    - `scripts` folder
