# The Art of Unix Programming

## Chapter 2. History

### Genesis: 1969-1971

1. Unix was born in 1969 out of the mind of a computer scientist at Bell Laboratories, Ken Thompson.

2. The standard interactive device on the earliest timesharing systems was the ASR-33 teletype â€” a slow, noisy device that printed upper-case-only on big rolls of yellow paper. The ASR-33 was the natural parent of the Unix tradition of **terse commands and sparse responses**.

3. When Bell Labs withdrew from the Multics research consortium, Ken Thompson was left with some Multics-inspired ideas about **how to build a file system**. (Question: So how?)

4. Ritchie observes: "What we wanted to preserve was not just a good environment in which to do programming, but a system around which a **fellowship** could form. We knew from experience that the essence of communal computing, as supplied by remote-access, time-shared machines, is not just to type programs into a terminal instead of a keypunch, but to encourage **close communication**".

5. The Unix tradition of **lightweight development and informal methods** also began at its beginning. Where Multics had been a large project with thousands of pages of technical specifications written before the hardware arrived, the first running Unix code was brainstormed by three people and implemented by Ken Thompson in two days.
