## 10 Functions

### Built-in browser functions

1. In fact, some of the code you are calling when you invoke a built in browser function couldn't be written in JavaScript â€” many of these functions are calling parts of the background browser code, which is written largely in low-level system languages like C++, not web languages like JavaScript.

### Anonymous functions

1. You generally use an anonymous function along with an event handler.
