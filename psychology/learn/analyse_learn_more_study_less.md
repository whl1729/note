## Q6：这本书的关键句是什么？

> 备注：找出关键句，并确认这些关键句所表达的主旨。

### Introduction

> This Book has two major goals. First, the holistic learning strategy should give you a model for how to learn better. Without an easily understandable theory of learning, it is difficult to make improvements. By seeing the holistic learning strategy you have a basis for identifying your weaknesses and improving the way you learn.

> The second objective of this book is to provide a variety of learning techniques.  Throughout the book I’ll explain what these techniques are and how they fit within the holistic learning strategy. Included with this book are exercise printouts so you can practice these methods.

伍注：作者的写作目标：其一是介绍整体性学习法的策略（或者说框架、模型、理论等），其二是提供整体性学习法的一系列学习技术。

### Part 1 The Holistic Learning Strategy

> That different strategy I called holistic learning. I call it holistic learning because it challenges you to view learning as a comprehensive whole, instead of a list of memorized facts. Smart people tend to make fewer distinctions between branches of knowledge and can easily relate one set of understandings to another.

> By learning holistically, smart people are able to quickly integrate new information. More importantly, this information sticks. They actually "get" the concepts and see how the concepts relate to far more than just the problems given.

> Holistic learning is a theory for learning that more accurately describes how your brain works. ...... Your brain stores information as associations between billions of neurons.

> Holistic learning takes a different approach.  Instead of trying to memorize information by making a perfect copy in your brain, it uses the web of neurons you have. Holistic learning creates webs of information. One idea relates to another idea. That interrelating of ideas allows you to easily navigate through complete understandings.

> With holistic learning, ideas aren’t learned in isolation. If you follow holistic learning closely enough, you’ll soon realize that it is impossible to learn an idea in isolation. Learning anything requires associations. **The more associations you can create and the stronger those associations are, the better.**

> Holistic learners connect everything. A derivative isn’t just a formula, it’s a feeling, an image and you can relate it to flying a supersonic jet.

伍注：这里阐述了“整体性学习法”的核心理念：把知识视为整体，认为知识之间是相互联系的，因此在学习新知识时应该把它与已学知识联系起来。相反的做法可以称为“孤立学习法”，即把知识看做孤立的个体，从来不寻找某个知识与其他知识之间的联系。显然，前者的学习效果可以碾压后者。因为联系越多，理解得越深刻，记忆也越牢固，应用时也就越得心应手。

> A construct defines a set of tightly interlinked understandings. For example, if you’ve tried your hand at learning to create programs with C++, you probably have a C++ construct. This construct defines all your knowledge about C++ and is the sum total of all the interconnected ideas about C++.

> Think of a construct as being like a city in your mind. Within a city you have thousands of buildings you can travel between. Some are big and important and are linked by roads to hundreds of other buildings in your city. Others are less important and only have a few dirt paths leading to them.

> In the landscape of your knowledge, your mind is full of these cities.

> Understanding is the result of a highly developed construct.

> When building constructs, your goal is to create as many possible interconnections as possible between ideas.

伍注：Constructs（结构），完整地说应该是Knowledge Constructs（知识结构），某个学科/主题/领域的结构就是这个学科/主题/领域所包含的所有知识及它们之间的联系。

> Models are **simplified** constructs. They are snapshots of larger understandings designed to be portable and easy to store. Models are essential when trying to learn new concepts quickly.

> To understand what a model is, think about this book. A model for this book would be the table of contents.

> Models can take a variety of forms. The goal, however, is always the same: **compressing information**. By taking several core concepts and linking them together into one form, you create a model. Models are essential when you are just starting to build a construct or making large additions to current constructs.

> A model doesn’t need to be an image. It only needs to be an existing understanding that compresses several key ideas into one. There are many ways to generate and expand models which I’ll discuss later in the book. Visualization is only one method.

> The takeaway point about models is that they act like seeds for constructs. Like a small group of pioneers with compact building materials heading to fresh ground to start a new settlement. A compressed set of key ideas that can be expanded. （模型就像是结构的种子，是一座建筑的地基和框架，是知识最核心的概念，在此基础上引伸出全部的知识。）

伍注：Models（模型），是简化的结构，更准确地说，是经过信息压缩但仍保留核心思想的结构。作者举了四个模型的例子：目录是书籍的模型，蓝色三维空间中的红色网格是子空间的模型，罐子是（编程中的）变量的模型，铅笔刀是（编程中的）函数的模型。它们的共同点是：都对原来的信息进行了压缩，但能保留其核心思想。

> Constructs are built on roads linking buildings with one another. While having hundreds of intercity roads is useful, it doesn’t make use of the real power of your holistic brain. In order to do that, you need to add highways: linkages between isolated constructs.

> A highway is a reference that links two completely different ideas. If you were reading a biology textbook and made comparisons from evolution to business courses you are taking, that would be a highway.

> Thinking "outside the box" might as well describe people who think outside of constructs. Highways allow them to do this by making connections between areas that they didn’t previously think were connected. Creativity can be seen as being able to utilize these highways to build new constructs in territories that were previously empty.

伍注：Highways（高速公路），是指在两个看起来完全没关联的知识之间建立联系。我的进一步理解：我们可以把所有知识按照树状结构与网状结构组织为一个整体，那么任意两个知识点总会有联系——一个最弱的联系是它们都是知识。假设现在有两个知识点A和B，它们之间的联系最弱，可以理解为需要从A向上返回到根节点、再沿另一条路径才能到达B。而高速公路做了啥事情呢？它在A和B之间建立了一条专线，因此A和B可以直接联系起来了。

> **Understanding** means taking raw information and giving it a context. This would be the most basic interlinking you would need to perform in order to learn.

> **The Explore Phase** is really where holistic learning takes full force. Here you form the models, highways and broader connections needed for well defined constructs.

伍注：根据以上描述，建立结构应该是在理解阶段完成，建立模型和高速公路是在拓展阶段。注意，这里也提到理解的方法在于联系上下文。这与《如何阅读一本书》中提到的通过上下文理解关键词/关键句不谋而合。

> **The Debug Phase** looks for errors in your models and highways. This phase prunes back your connections so invalid ones won’t remain, or will be constrained to the area they work.

> **The Apply Phase** takes debugging to the final level by making adjustments compared to how this information operates in reality. Having a set of understandings is useless if they aren’t tailored to the real world. Failure on this step could be an example of people who have book-smarts but can’t seem to use them outside the class.

> **Test** - Continuously you should be testing your methods and learning throughout **all six stages**. This will help you quickly identify problems in the system you use for learning, and help you develop new techniques to combat weaknesses.

> When acquiring information, you have three major goals: (1) Simplicity, (2) Volume, (3) Speed.

> The holistic learning sequence could be seen as taking three layers, each expanding the degree of understanding. The Understand Phase forms the first layer, followed by Explore and finally Apply. Each provides more depth to the information you come across.

伍注：这里提到整体性学习法的不同阶段对知识的理解程度不一样。在理解阶段，我们只是理解了某个知识点（它的含义、思想、原理等）；在拓展阶段，我们把这个知识点与其他知识点联系起来，因此能理解得更深刻；在应用阶段，我们将这个知识点应用到现实生活中，又比拓展阶段理解得更深刻一些。

> With the Understand Phase, you are getting at the surface of information. （在理解阶段，你只是理解了信息的表面意思。）As an example, say you are learning a new mathematical formula. You know the basics of what the symbols in the formula stand for, and possible problems that could be solved using this formula.

> **The Understand Phase, is where most people stop and smart people go beyond.**

伍注：这里值得警醒：学习不能只停留在理解某个知识的表面意思。还应该拓展知识、应用知识！

> Exploration is really the start of holistic learning. With your basic understanding that covers the surface of information, you now try to link that information to other concepts. Here you would start using models to simplify and expand your constructs. You would also broaden your understanding of not only how the information is derived, but what it is related to.

> A holistic learner would take the formula I mentioned in the last phase, and explore it. Where does it come from? What do the different components of the formula represent? What elements of the formula can be altered and how does that change results? What other formulas are similar to this in function or form?

> There are three major ways you can explore ideas: **depth, lateral and vertical exploration**.

> Information comes from somewhere. Where does a formula come from? How was a discovery made? Why are things the way they are?

> Depth exploration requires that you create links into information. Instead of just understanding a formula, you understand its proof. You understand why the proof was developed and by whom. Now, through depth exploration, your formula becomes supported underneath a foundation of other linked ideas.

伍注：深度拓展，指理解知识的来龙去脉，知其然也要知其所以然。简单地说就是问为什么：为什么是这样的？为什么发展成这样的？为什么需要它？（有一点点像深度搜索）

> Information doesn’t stand alone. What formulas are similar to this one in function or design? What other discoveries were made at the same time, by the same person or in the same field? What other facts surround this one?

> Lateral exploration requires that you create links around information. Usually this means that you take models and link information between them. Relating one event that occurred in Ancient Greece with another event that took place in Ancient China.

伍注：水平拓展，指类比相似的知识点。相似点可以是时间、地点、发现者、主题、核心思想等等。（有一点点像广度搜索）

> Information follows patterns, those patterns can be found in other information. Can I compare this formula to a natural event, like water flowing or driving a car? How does this discovery relate to a completely different historical event? How is this idea similar to completely different ideas.

> Methods such as metaphor and visceralization work well within vertical exploration.

伍注：纵向拓展，指在看似无关联的知识点之间寻找联系。可以应用比喻法和内在化法来进行纵向拓展。

> Creating diagrams can help with vertical, lateral and depth exploration. Metaphor and visceralization both work best with vertical exploration. However, holistic learning doesn't need to be fancy, just by getting curious and asking questions you can explore an idea.

> Learning is not error free. The problem with interlinking, is that a wrong connection can create false understandings. This happens when you believe you understand an idea, but the relationship it is based on is faulty.

> Debugging can be seen as pruning back the holistic web. Adding exceptions and breaking connection that don’t exist in reality. This isn’t a perfect process, but it is necessary to seek information that will clean up the desire to find patterns.

> Debugging can take many forms, from reading books from authors that oppose your points of view (and can point out errors in your reasoning) to testing your information in the world and seeing where it doesn’t apply.

伍注：在纠错阶段，需要定位出前面阶段建立的结构、模型或高速公路存在的问题，并加以修正。定位的方法可以是阅读观点想法的书籍或在实际应用中发现问题等。

> Each one of these five phases needs to be accompanied by testing. Whenever you try new methods, information might get lost or absorbed differently. Testing allows you to track what your weaknesses are, so improvements can be made.

> Testing should determine what level of understanding you have for any idea.  Here’s the questions you need to ask yourself:
> Acquire Test - Have I seen/listened to the idea before?
> Understand Test - Do I get (at a surface level) what this idea means?
> Explore Test - Do I understand where this idea comes from, what it is related to and what outside ideas can be connected with it?
> Debug Test - Have I removed inappropriate links between this idea and others?  Have I removed false conclusions based on connections that don’t actually exist?
> Apply Test - Have I used this idea in my practical life?

伍注：整体性学习的每个阶段都需要测试其成果，测试方法是回答一些问题。可以先将这些通用的问题整理成一份模板。

> The sequence of holistic learning isn’t really a sequence at all. Instead it is a cycle that constantly jumps between steps. Understanding information goes back to Acquiring and then onto Exploration and Application before Debugging. **Try to avoid seeing these steps as linear but as part of an ongoing cycle to create understandings.**

伍注：实际学习时不是严格按照五个阶段的顺序来进行。步骤之间可以往返或跳跃，总之具体问题具体分析。

> What are your weak links in the chain of holistic learning? Identifying weak points is a matter of regular testing. More broadly, you need to pinpoint where your chronic weaknesses are. Everyone has different strengths and weaknesses when it comes to learning. ...... Finding your chronic weak points can tell you what techniques you need to master.

伍注：找出薄弱的环节！我的薄弱环节应该是拓展和应用阶段。因为以前很少训练自己进行知识的拓展，也很少能做到学以致用。

> Getting to the surface understanding can’t be done through magic. My suggestion, if this is your stumbling block, is to seek as many well-written explanations as possible.

伍注：如果不能理解，可以尝试寻找其他写得更好、解释得更清楚的材料来阅读。

> A sign you don’t do enough debugging is if you don’t regularly find yourself to be wrong on a major belief or issue. If you always think you are correct, chances are you aren’t doing enough critical examination of the connections you make.

伍注：如果你一直认为自己是对的，那么你很可能在哪里弄错了。

> I’ve come up with a few simple categories that can help you decide what structure your learning tasks fit in: **1. Arbitrary 2. Opinion 3. Process 4. Concrete 5. Abstract.**

> Some information sits in-between categories: physics can often move between concrete and abstract. Biology can go between arbitrary and concrete. In fact, most topics have elements of each structure.

> Your first goal with arbitrary information is to make it less arbitrary. If there is a logical pattern in the information, try to find that first. Otherwise the job of remembering and using the information becomes more difficult.

> If that can’t be accomplished, these methods also work well: 1. Linking 2. Pegging 3. Compression

伍注：对于随意信息，首先尝试寻找其中的逻辑关系，不行再使用联想法、挂钩法或信息压缩法来记忆。

> With opinion information, your biggest problem is the acquiring phase. You need to examine a large volume of information and look for patterns, rather than memorize specific details. Speed reading techniques are a great asset in gathering information. Diagraming is also a useful method with opinion information. It can help you distill your key ideas after reading.

> Most process information relies on having the right models. While a construct can be formed slowly with practice, having the right models can speed up learning. Here are some techniques to improve your models: 1. Visceralization 2. Metaphor 3. Diagraming 4. Model Debugging.

> Most of the techniques listed in the second half of the book will work well with concrete information. Visceralization can be helpful if you want to put information into more than one of your senses.

> When dealing with abstract information, you need to move it to a concrete level. ...... Visceralization and metaphor are essential to bring complex ideas down to a basic level. Model debugging plays prominent role because your initial attempts to model an idea may have unintended errors.

伍注：注意5种类型的信息分别有对应的学习技术。作者在第二部分有详细介绍。

> The ultimate step in holistic learning is to take the information you have learned and give it practical value. Almost any subject can have practical value if you choose to look for it. Giving a subject value in your daily life creates a far greater connection within your mental web than any technique I can possibly describe in Part II.

伍注：最重要的是学以致用。
