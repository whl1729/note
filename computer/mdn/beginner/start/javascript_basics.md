# Reading Note: JavaScript Basics

1. JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that can add **interactivity** to a website. It was invented by **Brendan Eich** (co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation).

2. Tools written on top of the core JavaScript language
  - Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.
  - Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.
  - Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications.
