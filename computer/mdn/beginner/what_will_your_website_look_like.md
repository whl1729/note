# Reading Note: What will your website look like?

1. Three steps to design your website:
    - Planning
    - Sketching out your design
    - Choosing your assets

2. Planning: To begin, answer these questions:
    - What is your website about? Do you like dogs, New York, or Pac-Man?
    - What information are you presenting on the subject? Write a title and a few paragraphs and think of an image you'd like to show on your page.
    - What does your website look like, in simple high-level terms? What's the background color? What kind of font is appropriate: formal, cartoony, bold and loud, subtle?

3. Sketching out your design: grab pen and paper and sketch out roughly how you want your site to look. You should get in the habit of doing this now.

4. Choosing your assets
    - Text.
    - Theme color. Go to the Color Picker and find a color you like.
    - Images. Go to Google Images and search for something suitable.
    - Font. Go to Google Fonts and scroll down the list until you find one you like.
