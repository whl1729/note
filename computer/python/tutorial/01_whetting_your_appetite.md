# The Python Tutorial

## 01 Whetting Your Appetite

1. Python is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, **offering much more structure and support for large programs** than shell scripts or batch files can offer. On the other hand, Python also **offers much more error checking** than C, and, being a very-high-level language, it has **high-level data types built in**, such as flexible arrays and dictionaries. Because of its more general data types Python is applicable to a much larger problem domain than Awk or even Perl, yet many things are at least as easy in Python as in those languages.

2. Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:
    - the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;
    - statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;
    - no variable or argument declarations are necessary.

3. Python is extensible: if you know how to program in C it is easy to add a new built-in function or module to the interpreter, either to perform critical operations at maximum speed, or to link Python programs to libraries that may only be available in binary form (such as a vendor-specific graphics library). Once you are really hooked, you can link the Python interpreter into an application written in C and use it as an extension or command language for that application.

4. The language is named after the BBC show “Monty Python’s Flying Circus” and has nothing to do with reptiles.
