## How to search on Google

1. Choose words carefully
    - When you're deciding what words to put in the search box, try to choose words that are likely to appear on the site you're looking for. For example, instead of saying my head hurts, say headache, because that’s the word a medical site would use.

2. Find quick answers
    - For many searches, Google will do the work for you and show an answer to your question in the search results. Some features, like information about sports teams, aren't available in all regions. 
    - Weather: Search weather to see the weather in your location or add a city name, like weather seattle, to find weather for a certain place.
    - Dictionary: Put define in front of any word to see its definition. 
    - Calculations: Enter a math equation like 3\*9123, or solve complex graphing equations.
    - Unit conversions: Enter any conversion, like 3 dollars in euros.
    - Sports: Search for the name of your team to see a schedule, game scores and more. 
    - Quick facts: Search for the name of a celebrity, location, movie, or song to find related information. 

## Refine web searches

1. Don’t put spaces between the symbol or word and your search term. A search for site:nytimes.com will work, but site: nytimes.com won’t.

2. Common search techniques
    - Search social media
        - Put @ in front of a word to search social media. For example: @twitter.
    - Search for a price
        - Put $ in front of a number. For example: camera $400.
    - Search hashtags
        - Put # in front of a word. For example: #throwbackthursday
    - Exclude words from your search
        - Put - in front of a word you want to leave out. For example, jaguar speed -car. (Notice: There is no blank between - and the word)
    - Search for an exact match
        - Put a word or phrase inside quotes. For example, "tallest building".
    - Search within a range of numbers
        - Put .. between two numbers. For example, camera $50..$100.
    - Combine searches
        - Put "OR" between each search query. For example, marathon OR race.
    - Search for a specific site
        - Put "site:" in front of a site or domain. For example, site:youtube.com or site:.gov.
    - Search for related sites
        - Put "related:" in front of a web address you already know. For example, related:time.com.
    - See Google’s cached version of a site
    - Put "cache:" in front of the site address.

## Filter your search results

1. On your computer, in a browser like Chrome or Firefox, do a search on Google. Below the search box:
    - To pick the type of result you want to see, click the type of result, like Images or News.
    - To see extra choices, click More.
    - To see more filters you can use, click Tools.
    - Tip: The tools you see will change based on your search and filters. So you won't see all the options every time.
