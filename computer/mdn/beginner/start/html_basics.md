# Reading Note: HTML Basics

1. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to **structure** a web page and its content.

2. HTML consists of a series of **elements**, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.

3. An element is a part of a webpage. In XML and HTML, an element may contain a data item or a chunk of text or an image, or perhaps nothing. A typical element includes an opening **tag** with some **attributes**, enclosed text **content**, and a closing tag.

4. Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. An attribute should always have the following:
  - A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).
  - The attribute name followed by an equal sign.
  - The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.

5. You can put elements inside other elements too - this is called nesting. **The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are clearly inside or outside one another.**

6. Some elements have no content and are called **empty elements**, such as `<img>`.

7. Anatomy of an HTML document
  - `<!DOCTYPE html>`
  - `<html></html>`
  - `<head></head>`
  - `<meta charset="utf-8">`
  - `<title></title>`
  - `<body></body>`

8. Marking up text
  - Headings
  - Paragraphs
  - Lists
  - Links
